# E04a-Sprites Exercise

Hey, it's Larry.
So, probably the latest thing I've ever made.  I'll be honest, after I tried and failed to get my Super Text Adventure
or whatever the heck made, I seriously fell off the ball.  I can only hope that these coming assignments will
catch me back up.
But I probably can't guarantee they'll be stellar.  As we speak, I'm having to work off of a computer that does not
grant me admin permissions, nor does it already have what I need on it.  As such, all the coding that I do for this
exercise and probably a few after it is/will be nothing but guesswork since, due to me being unable to obtain and use
the programs and whatnot that they require, I can't actually *run* the files to test them.  So it might not work,
but to hell if that's gonna stop me from trying.  I dug myself in this hole, and now I'm gonna try to claw out of it.

So, for what I did here.  I basically did the main exercises as intended, and for the fourth exercise to draw our own
scene, I went for a motif of gems.  As I do.  I basically tried to set up the system to just draw an absolute slew of
jewels, but when it came to you clicking them, you could remove them and potentially clear them all away, for an extra
layer of interactivity.  And I'm really hoping that works because I need every extra credit point I can earn.

Until next exercise.  Cheers.
